# Contributing

Pull requests go into the `master` branch. The `gh-pages` branch is a presentation of the `master` branch at the last given push.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run the *Specificity Visualizer* locally.
- Clone the repository with
`git clone https://github.com/isellsoap/specificity-visualizer.git`
- Go into the folder with
`cd specificity-visualizer`

## Building

- Install the dependencies with
`npm install`
- Build all the assets once with
`npm run build`
or watch the files continuously with
`npm run watch`
- This will create the `index.html` in the `dist` folder which you can now open in your browser.
